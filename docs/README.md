## [Project 1 - Clock](../Project%201%20-%20Clock)

A clock console app written in C++.

Displays a 12 and 24-hour clock with a menu to add time (hour, minute, second) or exit the program. Added an option to the menu for the clock to auto-refresh in the console. Couldn't get it to work with refreshing the time and still enabling menu selection.

## [Project 2 - Investment Banking](../Project%202%20-%20Investment%20Banking)

A compound interest calculator console app written in C++.

Gathers input from the user for initial investment amount, additional monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and number of years.  The user is then given options to view an investment report showing the yearly growth including or excluding the additional monthly deposits.  There are also options to update any of the prior input amounts or exit the program.

## [Project 3 - Inventory Tracking](../Project%203%20-%20Inventory%20Tracking)

An inventory tracker console app written in C++ and Python.

Reads in a file containing the name of each item sold in a day, with the item being listed each time it is sold.  From that data it generates a list of distinct items sold and the quantity sold for each item.  That inventory list is then written to a new file.  A menu then gives options to display the inventory list, search the list for an item and display the quantity sold, or display a histogram showing the frequency of each item sold.
