# cs-210-clock
A clock console app in C++.

Displays a 12 and 24-hour clock with a menu to add time (hour, minute, second) or exit the program.  Added an option to the menu for the clock to auto-refresh in the console.  Couldn't get it to work with refreshing the time and still enabling menu selection.
