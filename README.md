## [Project 1 - Clock](https://github.com/eslutz/CS-210-Projects/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Clock)

A clock console app written in C++.

Displays a 12 and 24-hour clock with a menu to add time (hour, minute, second) or exit the program. Added an option to the menu for the clock to auto-refresh in the console. Couldn't get it to work with refreshing the time and still enabling menu selection.

## [Project 2 - Investment Banking](https://github.com/eslutz/CS-210-Projects/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20Investment%20Banking)

A compound interest calculator console app written in C++.

Gathers input from the user for initial investment amount, additional monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and number of years.  The user is then given options to view an investment report showing the yearly growth indlucing or excluding the additional monthly deposits.  There are also options to update any of the prior input amounts or exit the program.
